People love lists! And if you run a successful blog, you probably have many lists throughout your posts. But those lists tend to be boring bullet lists such as:

![Bullet List](https://github.com/checklist/wordpress/blob/master/checklist-com/assets/screenshot-1.png)

And here is what this list would look once you let the Checklist plugin render it:

![Beautiful Interactive Checklist](https://github.com/checklist/wordpress/blob/master/checklist-com/assets/screenshot-2.png)

And once your visitors save the list to their Checklist app (on iOS/ Android and Web), it will show as follows:

![Checklist app](https://github.com/checklist/wordpress/blob/master/checklist-com/assets/screenshot-6.png)

Notice how you get the sticky relationship as the list includes a link back to your blog which the user will see every time they use the list (even months after).

### The Advantages
* Let users enjoy a beautiful interactive checklist rather than a boring bullet list
* Let users save the list for later (with a link back to your blog)
* Let users print your lists (sourcing your blog)
* Turn visitors into returning users (increase page views)
* Increase your brand awareness
* Get exposure on Checklist.com 
* Monetize your lists

### How It Works

Start by installing the plugin in your Plugins directory (or via the WordPress one click install)

Select any bullet list (or create a new one) in your Wordpress post editor. In the following example we take a list of baby items an expecting mom should buy:

![Selected list](https://github.com/checklist/wordpress/blob/master/checklist-com/assets/screenshot-3.png)

Click on the Checklist button from the editor and get the Checklist popup to customize your checklist:

And voila: you have a [baby checklist](https://checklist.com/baby-checklist/). 

To customize the overall look and feel of the plugin to fit your blog's, head over to the Checklist settings page from the WordPress admin menu:

### Where can I use this?

Naturally, you can use this for any list on your site. Here are a few examples:
* Action list. Things to do. E.g. DIY instructions
* Shopping lists. Things you will need to get something accomplished. E.g. DIY lists
* Recipes. Inclued a list of ingredients
* Trip Plans. Lists of places to visit
* Bookmarks. Lists of links. E.g. if you have just listed the top 20 Wordpress themes, why not place a list at the end which the user can take with them and further look into
* List of tips
* Summary. See the tip below.

And the list goes on. Let us know if you have an idea we can add to this list.

Tip: Why not end (and even start) each blog post with a list which summarizes the article? This can be something the reader can take away with them.

So get started with turning your boring lists into shining interactive checklists!
